## Releases

## Hack The Code

`yarn` is strongly recommended instead of `npm`.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
yarn run dev

# build electron app for production
yarn run build

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `app/src`
yarn run lint

# run webpack in production
yarn run pack
```

## Thanks

This project was generated from [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).
